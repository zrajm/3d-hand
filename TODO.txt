* [1/7] Soon
** TODO Thumb
** TODO Finger spreading
** TODO Add palm
** TODO Improve fingertip shape
   Should maybe include some kind of fingernails? Or at least not approximate finger tips as half a sphere, but have something hinting at the shape of an actual fingertip.
** TODO Light source should be stationary
   When rotating the hand, the light source should remain stationary.
** TODO Remove hidden surfaces                                     :OPTIMIZE:
   For example the finger segments are created using spheres and cylinders, creating a lot of unnecessary surfaces that are hidden inside each finger segment. The end bits should be half spheres, attached to cylinders open cylinders (that is the cylinders should not have lids at either ends).

   The Three.js `SphereGeometry` class has an options `phiStart` and `phiLength` which may be used to draw half spheres. Use this?

* [0/2] Future
** TODO Prettier light & material
   Maybe take inspiration from this? [[https://discourse.threejs.org/t/white-toon-material/55762][White toon material]]

   Maybe make something inspired by the illustrations in Svenskt teckenspr√•kslexikon? (That is, something that looks drawn rather than photographic.) Or maybe something more toon like would look better, given that the hand isn't very natural looking?
** TODO Support transcription

   Currently CPU cycles are used even when object remains stationary. :(
